# UCLA Bruin Supermileage
Bruin Supermileage builds and competes with two vehicles every year: an Electric Vehicle (EV) and an Internal Combustion or Gas Vehicle (GV). We compete in the Shell Eco-marathon Americas competition, where we are challenged to design, build, and race the most fuel-efficient vehicles. We strive to push the boundaries of what is technically possible, giving students invaluable experience and real world engineering skills. With a focus on improving energy efficiency, we help reduce the harmful environmental effects of gasoline combustion.
